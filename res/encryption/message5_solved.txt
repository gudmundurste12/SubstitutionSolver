I am the very model of a modern major general,
I've information, vegetable, animal and mineral.
I know the kings of England and I quote the fights historical
from Marathon to Waterloo in order categorical.

I'm very well acquainted, too, with matters mathematical,
I understand equations, both the simple and quadratical.
About binomial theorem I'm teeming with a lot of news
with many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse.

I'm very good at integral and differential calculus;
I know the scientific names of beings animalculous:
In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,
I am the very model of a modern Major-General.


In fact, when I know what is meant by "mamelon" and "ravelin",
When I can tell at sight a Mauser rifle from a javelin
When such affairs as sorties and surprises I'm more wary at,
And when I know precisely what is meant by "commissariat",

When I have learnt what progress has been made in modern gunnery,
When I know more of tactics than a novice in a nunnery –
In short, when I've a smattering of elemental strategy - 
You'll say a better Major-General has never sat a gee

For my military knowledge, though I'm plucky and adventury,
Has only been brought down to the beginning of the century;
But still, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,
I am the very model of a modern Major-General.
